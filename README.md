:exclamation: :exclamation: :exclamation:

This API may have issues when the PokemonGO servers are under high load or down, in this case please wait for the official to get back up. You can check the official servers status on [IsPokemonGoDownOrNot.com](http://ispokemongodownornot.com) or [MMOServerStatus.com](http://www.mmoserverstatus.com/pokemon_go).

This API doesnt fake the official client perfectly, niantic may know that you arent using the official app, we encourage you to use a alternate account to play with this API.

If you are using this lib to catch pokemon and loot pokestop, take care that you arent teleporting, the servers may issue a softban against your client (its temporary, between 10 and 30 minutes in general).

# Build from source
  - Clone the repo and cd into the folder
  - `` git submodule update --init ``
  - `` ./gradlew build ``
  - you should have the api jar in ``build/libs/PokeGOAPI-Java-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar``

# Eclipse users:
  - build once : `` ./gradlew build ``
  - Right click on the project
  - Select Build path > Configure Build Path > Source > Add Folder
  - Select `build/generated/source/proto/main/java`
  - Finish

# Usage

  Import from Maven/Gradle/SBT/Leiningen using JitPack : [![](https://jitpack.io/v/Grover-c13/PokeGOAPI-Java.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#Grover-c13/PokeGOAPI-Java)

OR

  Import JAR in Eclipse
    - Right click on the project
    - Select Build path > Java Build Path
    - Select Libraries tab
    - Select Add External JARsâ€¦
    - Select `PokeGOAPI-Java/build/libs/PokeGOAPI-Java_bundle-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
    - Finish

Mostly everything is accessed through the PokemonGo class in the API package.
The constructor of PokemonGo class requires a CredentialsProvider object (which can be obtained from GoogleCredentialsProvider or PtcCredentialsProvider) and a OkHttpClient object.

# Usage Example:
```java
OkHttpClient httpClient = new OkHttpClient();

/** 
* Google: 
* The provider will return URL for the device, along with a code for the chosen account. 
* The user must enter the code into the webpage provided by that URL to obtain a token.
* This token is the access_token that will be used to access Niantic servers.
* You will also receive a refresh_token to request a new access_token.
* A new access_token should be requested when it will expire (every 15min).
*/
PokemonGo go = new PokemonGo(new GoogleCredentialProvider(httpClient, new GoogleLoginListener()), httpClient);

public class GoogleLoginListener implements OnGoogleLoginOAuthCompleteListener {
 
        @Override
        public void onInitialOAuthComplete(GoogleAuthJson auth) {
            logger.log("Waiting for the code " + auth.getUserCode() + " to be put in " + auth.getVerificationUrl());
        }
 
        @Override
        public void onTokenIdReceived(GoogleAuthTokenJson tokens) {
            // refresh_token is accessible here if you want to store it.
        }
}

/**
* After this, if you do not want to re-authorize the google account every time, you will need to store the refresh token
* The API does not store the refresh token for you
* log in using the refresh token like this :
*/
PokemonGo go = new PokemonGo(new GoogleCredentialProvider(httpClient, refreshToken), httpClient);

/**
* PTC is much simpler, but less secure.
* You will need the username and password for each user log in
* This account does not currently support a refresh_token. 
* Example log in :
*/
PokemonGo go = new PokemonGo(new PtcCredentialProvider(httpClient,username,password),httpClient);

// After this you can access the api from the PokemonGo instance :
go.getPlayerProfile(); // to get the user profile
go.getInventories(); // to get all his inventories (Pokemon, backpack, egg, incubator)
go.setLocation(lat, long, alt); // set your position to get stuff around (altitude is not needed, you can use 1 for example)
go.getMap().getCatchablePokemon(); // get all currently Catchable Pokemon around you

// If you want to go deeper, you can directly send your request with our RequestHandler
// For example, here we are sending a request to get the award for our level
// This applies to any method defined in the protos file as Request/Response)

LevelUpRewardsMessage msg = LevelUpRewardsMessage.newBuilder().setLevel(yourLVL).build(); 
ServerRequest serverRequest = new ServerRequest(RequestType.LEVEL_UP_REWARDS, msg);
go.getRequestHandler().sendServerRequests(serverRequest);

// and get the response like this :

LevelUpRewardsResponse response = null;
try {
		response = LevelUpRewardsResponse.parseFrom(serverRequest.getData());
	} catch (InvalidProtocolBufferException e) {
	   throw new RemoteServerException(e);
}

// its possible that the parsing fail when servers are in high load for example.
```

##Android Dev FAQ

  - I can't use the sample code! It just throws a login exception!

You're running the sample code on the UI thread. Strict mode policy will throw an exception in that case and its being caught by the network client and treating it as a login failed exception. Run the sample code on a background thread in AsyncTask or RXJava and it will work.

  - I want to submit a refactor so that this library will use Google Volley

This library is meant to be a Java implementation of the API. Google Volley is specific to Android and should not be introduced in this library. However, if you still want to refactor it, you should create it as a separate project.

   - How can I use Android's native Google sign in with this library?

You can't. The Google Identity Platform uses the SHA1 fingerprint and package name to authenticate the caller of all sign in requests. This means that Niantic would need to add your app's SHA1 fingerprint and package name to their Google API Console. If you ever requested a Google Maps API key, you went through the same process. An alternative would be using a WebView to access the web based OAuth flow. This will work with the client ID and secret provided by this library.
